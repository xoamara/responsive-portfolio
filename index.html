        <p>Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam. Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!</p>

        <p>They're moving to attack position. Shields up! Track them. They may come around for another pass. Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes. hey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device. Well, there's no trace of them, sir. Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit. Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area. Yes, Captain Needa.</p>
                    
        <p>Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.</p>
